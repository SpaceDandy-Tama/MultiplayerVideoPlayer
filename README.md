# MultiplayerVideoPlayer (MVP)

Multiplayer Video Player (MVP) lets you watch videos together with friends in real time.  

Whether it's a local file or an online video, MVP syncs playback across all participants. Each client can control playback independently, giving a **true multiplayer experience** — this isn't streaming, it's **real playback**, powered by UDP like a game engine.
